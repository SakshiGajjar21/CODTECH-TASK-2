PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The circuit is very simple, I have used the GPIO pins D1, D2, D5 & D6 to control the 4 relays. And the GPIO pins SD3, D3, D7 & RX connected with switches to control the 4 relays manually. I have used the INPUT_PULLUP function in Arduino IDE instead of using the pull-up resistors. I have used a 5V mobile charger to supply the smart relay module. Here, the D3 pin should not be connected with GND during the booting process of NodeMCU. 
If the NodeMCU is connected with the WiFi, then you can control the home appliances from Google Home App and also from the manual switches. You can also ask Google Assistant to turn on and off the appliances. You can control, monitor the real-time status of the relays in the Google Home App from anywhere in the world. You don't need any Google Home Nest device for this home automation project.
